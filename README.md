# react-pres
A very very simple presentation engine written in React, complete with React-related content. Uses webpack and hot-reloading so that you can edit code and see the results in the browser without refreshing the page.

# to install
`npm install`
`sudo npm install -g webpack-dev-server`

# to run
`webpack-dev-server --hot --inline`  

# to present
Right arrow to go to next slide, left arrow to go to previous slide, down arrow to bring up each bullet point. There's an alternative bullets component called SimpleBullets that you can swap out to demonstrate composability.
